# Waking Life

Named after my favorite movie, this is my code for one of the Udacity's iOS Development Nanodegree program apps. 

## Description

This app uses the TMDB API and allows you to see popular actors/actresses and their best work. See new and popular movies or even search for the movie you want. You can also save your favorite movies with no login required! 
Reminder: To use the app you need to get your own API Key.  
If you would like to see it working, or how I did it, feel free to download the code and test it for your self. Also! You should visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/letfelipemarques/) or my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marques.visarq/) to see some nice content about the project and my future enveadors.
